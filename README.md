# what-whale-classifier
Image classification of whales using transfer learning. Goal of this repo is to achieve a trained model ready for deployment, along with an ironed-out framework for training and evaluating image classification models on self-sourced data.

See [this repo](https://github.com/datahounds/what-whale) for a lightweight flask web app in which a trained model is deployed for inference.

> **Current status (24/06/2020):** In the (slow) process of fine tuning and comparing various pre-trained architectures.
