    "In this tutorial we will take a deeper look at how to finetune and feature extract the [torchvision models](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html), all of which have been pretrained on the 1000-class Imagenet dataset. This tutorial will give an indepth look at how to work with several modern CNN architectures, and will build an intuition for finetuning any PyTorch model. Since each model architecture is different, there is no boilerplate finetuning code that will work in all scenarios. Rather, the researcher must look at the existing architecture and make custom adjustments for each model.\n",

    "In this document we will perform two types of transfer learning: finetuning and feature extraction. In **finetuning**, we start with a pretrained model and update *all* of the model’s parameters for our new task, in essence retraining the whole model. In **feature extraction**, we start with a pretrained model and only update the final layer weights from which we derive predictions. It is called feature extraction because we use the pretrained CNN as a fixed feature-extractor, and only change the output layer. For more technical information about transfer learning see [**here**](https://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/) and [**here**](https://ruder.io/transfer-learning/).\n",

    "\n",
    "Now to the most interesting part. Here is where we handle the reshaping of each network. Note, this is not an automatic procedure and is unique to each model. Recall, the final layer of a CNN model, which is often times an FC layer, has the same number of nodes as the number of output classes in the dataset. Since all of the models have been pretrained on Imagenet, they all have output layers of size 1000, one node for each\n",
    "class. The goal here is to reshape the last layer to have the same number of inputs as before, AND to have the same number of outputs as the number of classes in the dataset. In the following sections we will discuss how to alter the architecture of each model individually. But first, there is one important detail regarding the difference between finetuning and feature-extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "When feature extracting, we only want to update the parameters of the last layer, or in other words, we only want to update the parameters for the layer(s) we are reshaping. Therefore, we do not need to compute the gradients of the parameters that we are not changing, so for efficiency we set the .requires_grad attribute to False. This is important because by default, this attribute is set to True. Then, when we initialize the new layer and by default the new parameters have `.requires_grad=True` so only the new layer’s parameters will be updated. When we are finetuning we can leave all of the .required_grad’s set to the default of True.\n",
